What each file does:
  * bionomics.cpp: fast functions in C++ to calculate summary statistics of interest from simulation output
  * bionomics.R: takes output generated by `peridomestic-simulation.R` and generates output to make figures
  * trivial-simulation.R: run MBITES on a very simple landscape (used for model comparison) and generate plots to compare with MBDETES
  * landscape-points.R: takes the raw point process output and makes distance matrix/movement matrices for each (run this before the landscape-kernels.R)
  * landscape-kernels.R: takes distance matrix/movement matrices and returns processed movement kernels (empirical and smoothed)
  * peridomestic-simulation.R: if you have used `landscape-points.R` to make landscape objects, this runs the main set of experiments
  * FIGURE-X.R: generate specific figures from the manuscript based on the output from `bionomics.R`
