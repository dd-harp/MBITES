\title{MBDETES: Calculate State Transitions Matrix}
\usage{
MBDETES_Approx(tileID)
}
\arguments{
\item{tileID}{an integer ID of a tile (must have already called \code{\link{Tile_Initialize}} and the appropriate \code{Human_XX_Initialize} routines)}
}
\value{
a list of length equal to number of sites in the tile \code{tileID} where
each element is a named matrix giving transition probabilities between MBDETES
states {F,B,R,L,O,D}
}
\description{
For each \code{\link{Site}} in a landscape, calculate approximate
state transitions matrix by calling \code{\link{MBDETES_StateTransitions}}.
This requires a full landscape and humans to be constructed first, as well as MBITES parameters to be set (the only MBITES initialization function that is not necessary is \code{MBITES_Initialize}).
