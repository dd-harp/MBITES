\description{
All pathogen objects need to be able to communicate with a pathogen pedigree, which
links all clonal variants together through a \code{id} and \code{parentID} field.
Pathogen models link human and mosquito contacts which occur during feeding, see \code{\link{MBITES-HostEncounter}}
for more details on the "host encounter" process.
}
\details{
All pathogen modules need to implement the following methods in humans:
\itemize{
\item add_pathogen(pathogen): during successful mosquito -> human transmission
}

All pathogen modules need to implement the following methods in mosquitoes:
\itemize{
\item pathogenDynamics
\item probeHost
\item feedHost
}

All pathogen modules need to implement the following methods in pathogens:
\itemize{
\item oneDay_human
}
}
