\title{Bionomics: Compute Vectorial Capacity (Mosquito-centric)}
\usage{
Bionomics_vectorialCapacityMosquito(mosquitos, EIP, spatial = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mosquitos}{a data.frame of parsed JSON mosquito output}

\item{EIP}{the length of EIP}

\item{spatial}{compute spatial dispersion of bites or not}
}
\value{
a list where each element corresponds to a mosquito.
Each mosquito has \code{VC}, which is the total number of secondary bites arising from it, and
\code{spatialVC} which is a list of origin/destination pairs tracking dispersion of each initial bite.
}
\description{
Takes in JSON output parsed into a data.frame object from
an MBITES simulation run.
Computes vectorial capacity, as well as its spatial dispersion, from a mosquito-centric (vector-centric)
algorithm, described as follows:
\enumerate{
\item For each mosquito iterate through all its bites:
}
\itemize{
\item If the bite had a successful blood meal (human to mosquito transmission only occurs during a blood meal)
find all pairs of bites seperated by more than EIP days, where the other bites can be probing events or blood meal events.
\item Add these secondary bites to the mosquito's individual vectorial capacity.
\item Optionally, record the sites where these secondary bites were dispersed to.
Mosquitoes that were still alive at the end of simulation are filtered out.
Please note that in order to reconstruct kernels for VC, the distance matrix between sites
must be preserved somewhere, as the mosquito only records the index of the site it visited, not the xy coordinates.
