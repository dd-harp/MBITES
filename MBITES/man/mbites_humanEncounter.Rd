\usage{
mbites_humanEncounter()
}
\description{
After calling \code{\link{mbites_chooseHost}}, the mosquito encounters the human host and attempts to feed.
The encounter process consists of several stages:
\enumerate{
\item Check initial survival to see if the mosquito survives to probe
\item Check if the mosquito is deterred from probing, if undeterred, call pathogen-specific routines \code{probeHost}
\item Check if the mosquito survived probing to attempt blood feeding
\item Check if the mosquito is able to successfully begin blood feeding; take a blood meal via \code{\link{mbites_BloodMeal}} and then call pathogen-specific routines \code{feedHost}
}
}
\details{
For details on what pathogen modules must implement, see \code{\link{PathogenGeneric}}
\itemize{
\item This method is bound to \code{Mosquito_Female$humanEncounter}.
}
}
