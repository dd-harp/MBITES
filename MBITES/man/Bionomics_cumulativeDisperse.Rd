\title{Bionomics: Compute Cumulative Dispersal}
\usage{
Bionomics_cumulativeDisperse(mosquitos)
}
\arguments{
\item{mosquitos}{a data.frame of parsed JSON mosquito output}
}
\description{
Takes in JSON output parsed into a data.frame object from
an MBITES simulation run and returns a data.frame of mosquito lifespans.
Mosquitoes that were still alive at the end of simulation are filtered out.
Returns a list where each element gives the sites a mosquito visited. If the mosquito
never left the natal site, just return 0 (0 cumulative distance traveled).
