\description{
This function sets up items related to timing for MBITES. It sets the closures used to sample time to event for next launch
(see \code{\link{MBITES-Timing}} for more details) in the global parameters object as well as sets public methods in the
female mosquito class to select estivation and mating behavior.
}
\details{
See \code{\link{MBITES-Setup}} for more details. Note that because of lazy evaluation of function arguments only arguments that are
needed for the specific models chosen need to be provided as input by the user.
