\title{Bionomics: Compute Oviposition Intervals and Number of Successful Oviposition Events}
\usage{
Bionomics_ovipositionInterval(mosquitos)
}
\arguments{
\item{mosquitos}{a data.frame of parsed JSON mosquito output}
}
\description{
Takes in JSON output parsed into a data.frame object from
an MBITES simulation run.
Computes the interval between successful oviposition events and the total number of
successful oviposition events in a mosquito's lifespan (0s are included, that is to say if a mosquito
never successfully oviposited it will contribute a 0 to the vector).
Mosquitoes that were still alive at the end of simulation are filtered out.
