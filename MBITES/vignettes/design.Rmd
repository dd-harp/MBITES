## Overview

There are several sources of information about this code. This code is described in a research paper, Wu, Sean L., et al. "Vector bionomics and vectorial capacity as emergent properties of mosquito behaviors and ecology." PLoS computational biology 16.4 (2020): e1007446. That paper details the model. The code, itself, has comments about what different parts represent. In this same repository, outside of the MBITES project directory, are examples of how to use the code. Here, I would like to add a description of the architecture of the code.

This code uses a particular approach to object-oriented design. It has two traits: the use of IDs, more often than references, and the use of dynamic method assignment to support variation in pathogen type. You will see that the four main classes (mosquito, human, resource, and pathogen) has an ID, and they refer to each other by looking up IDs within the larger simulation, which is the Tile object. More interesting is the dynamic method assignment.

During initialization, this code reads parameters and decides which pathogen to simulate. Depending on the pathogen, it decides which methods to assign to the Human and Mosquito classes. These methods control the daily time step of the pathogen and what happens during probing (mosquito-to-human transmission) and blood feeding (human-to-mosquito transmission).


## MBITES Classes

This section lists every R6 class in the project. The sub-headings beneath each
class describe members of the class which, themselves, may be R6 classes. In
addition, we call out queues, which contain events that will happen at a future
time.

![MBITES R6 Classes](./mbites_class.png)

-   Tile is an R6 class has [TILE-Class.R]

    -   Sites (R6)
    -   Mosquitoes (R6)
    -   Humans (R6)

    The Sites, Mosquitoes, and Humans aren't R vectors. They are a custom
    datatype implemented in C++ for efficiency. This type, called a HashMap, is
    especially quick at running an R apply over the Sites, Mosquitoes, or
    Humans. The function works just like a regular R apply function, except that
    it doesn't expect any return values, so it doesn't allocate memory for the
    applied function to return a value.

-   Site is an R6 class with [LANDSCAPE-Site.R]

    -   resources

        -   feeding resources, and weights

## MBITES Structure

The code creates instances of these R6 classes, and each instance has pointers
to other instances.

![MBITES R6 Object Structure](./mbites_structure.png)

## MBITES Sequence

Once we know the structure, we can better understand the order in which a
simulation calls functions in order to perform its job. Despite the
object-oriented code, the pattern is largely structured programming, meaning
top-down calls.

![MBITES R6 Sequence](./mbites_sequence.png)

The diagram is nice, but let's walk through the functions in more detail in order to find any reference to blood-feeding or human movement.
